Project Overview:
Welcome to my Capstone project completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate program offered by Merit America.

For this project, I assumed the role of a marketing analyst at Bellabeat, a leading manufacturer of health-focused products tailored for women.

Data Overview:
The project encompasses 18 datasets obtained from respondents who participated in a survey distributed via Amazon Mechanical Turk during the period from March 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016. Additionally, 30 Fitbit users provided consent for the submission of their personal tracker data, which includes minute-level data on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit?resource=download).
